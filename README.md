Clusters of Ash (Fraxinus spp.) Among Boise's Managed Street and Park Trees, Indicating Potential Future Spread of the Invasive Pest, Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis)

The emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, is an invasive beetle originally from Asia. It lays its eggs in the cracks of ash tree bark. After hatching, the larvae live under the bark, eating away at the tree for one to two years before turning into adult beetles.

The insect was first found in Michigan, in 2002, though it may have been in the U.S. since the late 1980s. In its natural habitat, there are typically factors that keep its population in check, such as resistant trees, predators, and parasitoid wasps. However, outside its native range, its numbers can rapidly increase, causing significant damage.

Once the emerald ash borer establishes itself in an area, most ash trees there will perish within approximately 10 years if no action is taken to manage it. Green ash and black ash are most susceptible. Although white ash displays some resistance, it often succumbs once other species are affected. Blue ash, on the other hand, poses a greater challenge for the insect due to its high tannin content, rendering its leaves unappealing. Nevertheless, the emerald ash borer poses a threat to the entire North American genus Fraxinus, having already decimated millions of trees and endangering the vast majority of the 8.7 billion ash trees across the continent.

The burden of managing these trees often falls on homeowners or local authorities. For municipalities, removing large numbers of dead or infested trees at once can be financially prohibitive. Therefore, a common approach is to slow down the rate of tree mortality by removing already infested trees and treating others with insecticides. This buys time for local governments to plan, remove, and replace affected trees gradually, ultimately saving money. For instance, treating the trees over a decade would cost about $10.7 billion in urban areas across 25 states, whereas replacing them all at once would require approximately $25 billion (with some estimates reaching as high as $60 billion). In Boise, 14% of managed street trees are ash trees, and 10% of park trees are ash. No new ash trees are being planted in Boise, even though the emerald ash borer has not been detected in Idaho yet.
